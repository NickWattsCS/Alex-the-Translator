# Alex-the-Translator

A project designed to read and parse a sentence in English, and translate it
into another using the programming concept of Grammar and Language.

Currently, the current goal is to translate basic English sentences into Spanish;
sentences like "I saw him" and "Where is the bathroom?"

Eventually, the goal would be to translate more complex sentences with different
sentence structures.

The project is written in C++ for the backend, but the current plan is to develop
the frontend using Python or Java.
